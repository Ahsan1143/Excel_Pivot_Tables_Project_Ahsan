Project Description: Sales Performance Analysis Using Excel
Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze sales performance for an e-commerce company using Excel's advanced tools such as pivot tables, data cleaning functions, and data visualizations. The project demonstrates proficiency in managing large datasets, performing insightful analysis, and delivering actionable recommendations.

Process:
1. Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicate rows using Excel’s Remove Duplicates feature to ensure accuracy in the dataset.
Addressed blank values in key columns:
Replaced missing delivery times with the average delivery time calculated using filtering techniques.
Replaced blank payment methods with "Unknown" to ensure consistency in categorical data.
Standardized inconsistent text values (e.g., "electronics" → "Electronics") using Excel’s PROPER function and Find & Replace tools.
Removed unnecessary columns that didn’t contribute to the analysis, such as unique transaction identifiers.

2. Analysis with Pivot Tables:
Created multiple pivot tables to summarize the data and extract key insights:

Total Revenue by Region and Product:

Used a pivot table to calculate the total revenue for each product category across all regions.
This helped identify the most profitable regions and products.
Top-Performing Sales Reps:

Analyzed revenue by sales rep to identify the top 5 performers, which can guide future incentive plans and resource allocation.
Monthly Sales Trends:

Grouped sales data by month using pivot tables to identify seasonal patterns and revenue spikes.
Visualized the trends using a line chart, revealing peak sales periods.
Average Delivery Time by Product Category:

Calculated the average delivery time for each product category to evaluate logistics performance.
Identified product categories with slower delivery times for potential improvements.

3. Data Visualization:
Created compelling visualizations to enhance storytelling:

Bar Chart: Total revenue by region, highlighting the highest-earning regions.
Line Chart: Monthly sales trends to visualize seasonal patterns.
Heatmap: Used conditional formatting to highlight top-performing regions based on total revenue.
Insights:
Top Region: The North region generated the highest revenue, particularly in the Electronics category.
Top Product: Electronics were the highest-grossing product category overall.
Sales Trends: Peak sales occurred during June/July, indicating a need for increased marketing efforts during these periods.
Delivery Performance: "Clothing" experienced slower delivery times, highlighting a need for logistics optimization.
Impact:
The analysis provides actionable recommendations for boosting revenue, optimizing logistics, and improving sales rep performance.
Demonstrated expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel, showcasing skills relevant to business intelligence and decision-making.
